**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Sheel Vakil**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
W3 Schools for the correct implementation of Math.random() function in JavaScript. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
This project was the first time I used JavaScript to implement sound in a web development project. Even though implementing the code in this project went smoothly, I wanted to know more about exactly how the functions we used worked and learn more about the documentation.  The link provided was fun to go to because I learned more about the different features that can be used and gave code examples of how they worked and more in-depth information about some of the methods we used in our code.  

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I want to learn to add more features like a timer that counts down with how much time you have left after each move. I didn't get much time to look into that feature, but I think learning to add features like that to make the game a bit more dynamic would be cool. Plus, I know some online web games have a simple username/login type section so you can keep track of your score and see the top rankings of everyone else. I am very curious about how exactly that is done in the web apps that I have seen before. Keeping track of that live information and updating it as needed probably requires more work and some database connected with javascript. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would add a feature where the user can choose what difficulty they want to play this game in, for example, easy, medium, or hard. Also, I would add a feature where the user can customize the game by choosing how many buttons they want and how many moves they want to play. Additionally, I'd add a feature where there is no limit on how many moves and the user keeps going until they get the pattern incorrectly to see how far they can go. It would be pretty cool to have a player enter a username to play with a username and showcase a rankings chart of the top players and their highest score.
